		<h1>Blog: Medical Study</h1>
		<p>My favorite client as a content writer was a molecular imaging company that needed blog articles summarizing some of the latest medical studies using PET and PET/CT scans for healthcare professionals. I learned how different kinds of molecular imaging worked, which methods were better for different concerns and conditions, and how to read and understand scientific research papers. Most importantly, through communications with my client, I learned how to write for medical professionals. This was my first-ever foray into technical writing, and the constant cycle of learning, processing, and writing for an audience whose knowledge and skills were outside of my own was a rewarding challenge.</p>
